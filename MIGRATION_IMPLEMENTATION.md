# TDengine to AWS InfluxDB Migration Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the data migration solution from TDengine to AWS-managed InfluxDB using Apache Flink on Amazon EMR. The migration was successfully completed using a REST-based connection approach to overcome native library dependency challenges in distributed environments.

## Implementation Approach

### Connection Strategy

We implemented two connection strategies for TDengine:

1. **Native Connection Mode (Initial Attempt)**
   - Required the TDengine native library (`libtaos.so`)
   - Failed in YARN containers due to library distribution issues
   - Connection URL format: `jdbc:TAOS://host:port/database`

2. **REST Connection Mode (Successful Implementation)**
   - Pure Java implementation without native library dependencies
   - Works in any environment including YARN containers
   - Connection URL format: `jdbc:TAOS-RS://host:port/database`
   - Based on the TDengine RESTful interface

### Key Components

1. **Flink Application**
   - `TDengineToInfluxDBMigrationREST.java`: Main application using REST connection mode
   - Source connector: Reads from TDengine using JDBC REST driver
   - Transformation: Maps TDengine schema to InfluxDB data model
   - Sink connector: Writes to InfluxDB using the official client library

2. **Build and Deployment**
   - Maven project with dependencies for Flink, TDengine JDBC, and InfluxDB client
   - Shade plugin to create an uber JAR with all dependencies
   - Deployment script to build and submit the job to EMR

3. **Verification**
   - Python script to query InfluxDB and verify data integrity
   - Confirms successful migration of all records

## Technical Details

### TDengine Connection

```java
// Load TDengine JDBC driver
Class.forName("com.taosdata.jdbc.TSDBDriver");
Class.forName("com.taosdata.jdbc.rs.RestfulDriver");

// Connect to TDengine using REST connection
String jdbcUrl = "jdbc:TAOS-RS://172.31.65.128:6041/test_db";
conn = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, "root", "taosdata");
```

### Data Transformation

```java
// Create a data point for InfluxDB
Point point = Point.measurement("sensors")
    .time(reading.getTimestamp(), WritePrecision.NS)
    .addField("temperature", reading.getTemperature())
    .addField("humidity", reading.getHumidity())
    .addField("pressure", reading.getPressure())
    .addField("status", reading.getStatus());

// Add tags
for (Map.Entry<String, String> tag : tags.entrySet()) {
    point.addTag(tag.getKey(), tag.getValue());
}
```

### InfluxDB Connection

```java
// InfluxDB connection parameters
private final String influxUrl = "https://influxdb-3-5bc2krpa3h3ehv.us-east-1.timestream-influxdb.amazonaws.com:8086";
private final String token = "QOufwGAWm70Kvx9sqC6eI4vL1Gn8VI0y_JATAuQSe_qOZisWotDcm8Jr40tf9vMTVEJj7Vl5pDkWtmUbkOXM-A==";
private final String org = "bingbing";
private final String bucket = "test";

// Create InfluxDB client
influxDBClient = InfluxDBClientFactory.create(influxUrl, token.toCharArray(), org, bucket);
writeApi = influxDBClient.getWriteApi();
```

## Execution Process

1. **Build the Application**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

2. **Submit to EMR**
   ```bash
   ./build_and_submit_rest.sh
   ```

3. **Verify Migration**
   ```bash
   python3 verify_migration.py
   ```

## Results

The migration was successfully completed with the following results:
- All 10,014 records from TDengine were migrated to InfluxDB
- Data integrity was maintained, including timestamps, measurements, and tags
- The migration process completed in approximately 21 seconds

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Native library dependency | Used REST connection mode instead of native mode |
| YARN container isolation | Eliminated need for native libraries with REST approach |
| Data model differences | Implemented mapping from TDengine schema to InfluxDB data model |
| Environment setup | Created scripts for building, deploying, and verifying |

## Next Steps

1. **Incremental Migration**
   - Implement change data capture (CDC) for ongoing replication
   - Track last migrated timestamp for incremental updates

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Increase parallelism for larger datasets
   - Implement batching for InfluxDB writes

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Implement dead-letter queue for failed records

4. **Monitoring**
   - Add metrics collection for migration process
   - Set up alerts for migration failures

## Conclusion

The migration from TDengine to AWS InfluxDB was successfully implemented using Apache Flink on Amazon EMR. The REST-based connection approach proved to be a robust solution for overcoming the challenges of distributed execution environments. This implementation can serve as a template for similar time series database migrations.
